    <p id='sellingjapan' class='plain-text'>Japan has produced exquisite art since Prehistoric times. From wooden sculptures to the iconic 'Great Wave of Kanagawa' in the 19th century. Japanese art has a strong personality enriched by constant influences from the continent. Japan especially influenced western post-impressionism. A large collection of temples showing the classic tatami mats and sliding doors are the greatest representation of Japanese vibe.<br><br>
                
The feudal era was represented by the new warrior class, the samurai. During Kamakura period (12th-14th centuries) budism was introduced from China and became popular among the samurai. During 16th century Portugal reached Japan; initiating commercial and cultural exchanges. Edo period was characterized by strict social order, isolationist policies, sustainable environmental management and development of arts and culture. It comes to an end in 1868 with the Meiji Restoration.</p>
